This is the codegen, a scratch-built meta-programing tool designed to
automatically generate much of the code for the megaminer AI programing
competition. In practice it does less than everything, but this tool is still
invaluable in speeding up development time so we can focus more on testing and
less on writing the backend.

The codegen takes a 'data.py' file that specifies details of the game: game
objects, actions, variables; and generates shells for most components of the
game, including the server, C++, Java, Python, and C# clients, and the
visualizer.

To run the codegen, run 'python main.py'. You can use -d to specify the data
file, otherwise it will assume './data.py'. You can use -o to specify an
output directory; it will assume './output'.

main.py does some prepatory work and then calls each of the individual code
writers for each of the components. Each writer will walk through its template
directory to find the templates used to create the files it produces, and puts
them into the output directory after processing.

It is your responsiblity, not codegen's, to run the makefile.

You need to install Mako compatible with Python 3 to run codegen:

sudo apt-get install python3-mako
